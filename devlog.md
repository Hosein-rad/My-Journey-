# My Journal
### day 1 (14/3/1404)
- setup vite + react
- set up git, github and this repo
- small bug fix. a "#" at the beginning of folder name caused running issues
- skimmed through half of a crashcourse on youtube called: react crashcourse by **Traversy Media**
- got a general idea of these concepts: components, stats and props, hooks, jsx and what react actually is

### day 2 (16/3/1404)
- finished crashcourse, too complex, decided to start scrimba react course
- learned more about react invironment and what it's really all about
- started scrimba course to gain more depth before starting the project

### day 3 (17/3/1404)
- hit a pay-wall on scrimba course, broke my heart!
- decided to start TheOdinProject course

### fast forward (24/3/1404)
- A lot of decision changes due to changes of situation... Israel attacks on most major cities = no more traveling to other cities and no more internship
- decided on a freelance path, started sharpening JS skills on Freecodecamp
- built half of a Todo app today. the rest of it for tomorrow

### day 11 (25/3/1404)
- almost finished the todo app. one annoying bug left that prevents me from adding localStorage...
- it seems you can't use isEmpty or .length or many other great things on objects!
- also another weird thing: apparently a variable with the value of an empty curly braces (const x = {}) is truthy !!
- also for some reason I can not just assign one object into another, I'd have to give the parent object a key name first

### day 12 (26/3/1404)
- coffee timer hit me hard and realized a lot, consider today as a rest day, but it was more of a pivotal day...

### day 14 (28/3/1404)
- full on internet blackout yesterday... not tryna bring excuses, but I am
- made a number sorter project yesterday with selection and bubble sort. it was fun, I liked it

### day 21 (4/4/1404)
- full on internet blackout for the last week, no github :( hopefully the war is over
- have been busy though, created over 10 small projects which will be loading daily.
- learned a lot, but most importantly, realized how important it is to read docs and explanations of each part I don't understand
- possibly the opportunity of going to another city and finding internship came back... fingers crossed

### day 23 (6/4/1404)
- covered over 85% of JS. I could confidently call myself 'Intermediate' in JS
- suprise suprise, things have changed again. Not safe to travel just yet. gonna become a great developer, F the internship route
- here's my plan in a nutshell: git/github 1-2days, then tailwind 4days, then react, APIs, a big project, react native, a mobile app and then portfolio.

### day 25 (8/4/1404)
- yesterday I learned basics of git and github, how to push pull branch add commit all the normal stuff
- today, started learning tailwind, learned how to install it and how it works in general, seems very straight forward
- found some great courses, very excited to start them. also, gotta download them all asap, in case the war goes down again, which seems like it will...

### day 27 (10/4/1404)
- today I deepened my understanding of CSS grid and flexbox. learned/memorized about 70% of Tailwind utility classes too
- quite a prodoctive day today, ~9h of work/study. gonna build a decent looking discord page with Tailwind tomorrow
- still no war attempts, hopefully stays this way. removing more and more non-programming stuff from my life. also decided to do +2-3 great projects instead of learning react native later
- got the idea of adding things to my already existing mini-projects instead of building new ones and pushing them here... Wish I did this earlier

### day 29 (12/4/1404)
- extra productive day! hands on work with Tailwind for 8hours. created the interface of apple.com (will finish it later)
- I was quite pissed at Tailwind yesterday ngl, but today, I kinda loved using it. it's so much easier to navigate between divs to style!
- if I keep it up like today, I'm sure I can land a job after 2 months.

### day 30 (13/4/1404) 
- I planned to learn deployment in 2 days, I got the simple stuff in ~2 hours, and postponed the more technical stuff after react and APIs
- started a React course, I see similarities between Tailwind class utilities and React components
- today was less coding, more theory/tutorials/reading docs. not as fun as yesterday. starting to feel a kind of joy from coding that I used to get from gaming (Dota 2)

### day 34 (17/4/1404)
- been quite productive last few days, learning React. conpletely forgot about github "green squares"! and honestly, don't see the point of it. it feels like kind of a show off, and easy to get around. don't see it as sth important anymore...
- havn't built anything worthwhile to upload anyways, might delete the previous repos too. eeh maybe not

### day 36 (19/4/1404)
- gave myself a break today. had a lot of doubt about my path and whether it will be possible to land a job.
- decided to spend the last month of summer going to Tehran and look for jobs personally.
- created a cool lookin 3-month plan in Figma and set it as my background
- also, even if I couldn't find a job in that month, very likely will resign temporarely from teaching to focus on programming this year. yeah, I'm committed hard!

### day 37 (20/4/1404)
- good day, 7/5hrs of coding so far, still got an hour or two left in me. my avg in these 37 days was 7 to 7/5 ish hours
- created a simple array methods playground in vite. asked GPT whether it's worth it to upload it in github. answer: Absolutely!
- been tackling between remote job and in-person job. I lean towards remote a lot, since my learning skyrockets this way.
- it would be a dream come true if I land a remote job... at this point I feel like I'm just repeating myself!

### day 47 (30/4/1404)
- so the last week wasn't as productive. 4hours avg. some house repair.
- today I came to library. it's 6pm and I've done a focused 7hour of study + production
- almost finished my calculator widget. I plan to stick it in the corner of my "golden" project. the functionality and a few debugging is over. just some tailwind styles to add so it matches the design I created in Figma.
- today was a solid 9/10.

### day 52 (4/5/1404)
- been leaning non-stop. finished React to a decent level, now I'm diving into the API world
- had no clue how useful and simple to grasp fetch API is! feels like a world opened up to me!
- nothing worth sharing these days... just creating and deleting small projects to learn delicate stuff

### day 61 (13/5/1404) 
- started a project called **Cryptionary**. this will be the project to showcase my skills. so I'll be going as deep as I can
- folder structure, wireframes, and a bit of UI is done so far
- very tired at the end of each day... been neglecting writing devlog. kinda don't see the point tho!

### day 71 (23/5/1404)
- since I had the plan to have the Cryptionary as my centerpiece, scope creep got to me and I started dabbling into backend
- today I realized the original plan was to specialize front-end first (React-tailwind-Figma)

### day 73 (4/6/1404) 
- last month have been harsh. unavoidable family things. my momentum was lost. today I restarted the hardcode study mode.
- I decided to put 2 weeks of 7-9hrs daily study to Node.js and express and MongoDB and MySQL.

### day 74 (15/6/1404) 
- Next.js; what a monster! I've recently figured out the capabilities of this amazing technology and how it can be a backend - use DBs - optimize images - super easy routing - SEO and much more ...
- the 'Cryptionary' project of mine is left unfinished sadly. I've decided to build a web app with student/teacher dashboard to make my teaching job a whole lot easier and more productive.
- so originally I was planning to find another teacher, pay him my salary fully so that I can keep leaarning and finding a programming job, but apparently it's not quite legally possible. that's pretty much the big plan change, followed up by view change. can't be coding for 8+ hours daily. gotta adapt. gonna be hard. but I will not allow myeslf to forget about coding again, like last year. I wish I could continue with full focus but... obsticles are showing up more and more
- the other big thing that was quite disappointing was the fact that me as an Iranian citizen, am not hirable remotely. both the sanctions and no payment ways, AND i'm a junior... forget about it! the new plan is to build and get exp here in Iran, then travel to a neighbour country and get exp there, THEN maybe, fingers crossed, I can get to the life I want, remote work, traveling around the world.
