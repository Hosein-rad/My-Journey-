# My Journal
### day 1 (14/3/1404)
- setup vite + react
- set up git, github and this repo
- small bug fix. a "#" at the beginning of folder name caused running issues
- skimmed through half of a crashcourse on youtube called: react crashcourse by **Traversy Media**
- got a general idea of these concepts: components, stats and props, hooks, jsx and what react actually is

### day 2 (16/3/1404)
- finished crashcourse, too complex, decided to start scrimba react course
- learned more about react invironment and what it's really all about
- started scrimba course to gain more depth before starting the project

### day 3 (17/3/1404)
- hit a pay-wall on scrimba course, broke my heart!
- decided to start TheOdinProject course

### fast forward (24/3/1404)
A lot of decision changes due to changes of situation... Israel attacks on most major cities = no more traveling to other cities and no more internship
- decided on a freelance path, started sharpening JS skills on Freecodecamp
- built half of a Todo app today. the rest of it for tomorrow

### day 11 (25/3/1404)
- almost finished the todo app. one annoying bug left that prevents me from adding localStorage...
- it seems you can't use isEmpty or .length or many other great things on objects!
- also another weird thing: apparently a variable with the value of an empty curly braces (const x = {}) is truthy !!
- also for some reason I can not just assign one object into another, I'd have to give the parent object a key name first

### day 12 (26/3/1404)
- coffee timer hit me hard and realized a lot, consider today as a rest day, but it was more of a pivotal day...

### day 14 (28/3/1404)
- full on internet blackout yesterday... not tryna bring excuses, but I am
- made a number sorter project yesterday with selection and bubble sort. it was fun, I liked it

### day 21 (4/4/1404)
- full on internet blackout for the last week, no github :( hopefully the war is over
- have been busy though, created over 10 small projects which will be loading daily.
- learned a lot, but most importantly, realized how important it is to read docs and explanations of each part I don't understand
- possibly the opportunity of going to another city and finding internship came back... fingers crossed

### day 23 (6/4/1404)
- covered over 85% of JS. I could confidently call myself 'Intermediate' in JS
- suprise suprise, things have changed again. Not safe to travel just yet. gonna become a great developer, F the internship route
- here's my plan in a nutshell: git/github 1-2days, then tailwind 4days, then react, APIs, a big project, react native, a mobile app and then portfolio.
